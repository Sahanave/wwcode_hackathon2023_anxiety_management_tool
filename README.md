## What is Prototyping?

[Prototyping](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/prototyping)
is a process for developing an idea, and it is used in different areas to test
or simulate it before launching it.

* A [prototype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype) is a version of what
  the product would be.
* Prototyping is the iterative process of idea development.

> "So, we will have some **prototypes** of an idea in the **prototyping**
> process."

Prototyping is a fundamental step for any product, idea, or service type because
it allows:

* develop an initial version,
* discover flaws,
* reduce costs,
* know the users' experience,
* test features, and
* also, generate [POCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-concept) or
  [MVPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) of the idea.

### Prototyping Tools

There are different tools according to the level of fidelity or similarity
between the idea and the final product. These levels can vary in the conceptual,
aesthetic, and functional.

* **Low-fidelity** prototyping is aÂ paper draft of the idea.
* **Mid-fidelity** prototyping can be produced in software as a mockup,
  replicating some fundamental functionalities of the idea. Some tools for
  prototyping are [Figma](https://www.figma.com),
  [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com), [Miro](https://miro.com),
  [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com).
* **High-fidelity** prototype may include some level of programming to replicate
  the final solution behavior fluidly. Some tools for prototyping are
  [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/),
  [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io).

## What is Streamlit?

[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) is a free, open-source, all-python framework.
It enables data scientists to build quickly interactive dashboards and machine
learning web apps, and they don't require experience with front-end web
development.

This framework has gained [attention and
popularity](https://www.datarevenue.com/en-blog/data-dashboarding-streamlit-vs-dash-vs-shiny-vs-voila)
among data scientists and machine learning programmers in recent years. Its
growth is due to the fact that it is:

* an easy-to-use tool,
* needs basic knowledge of Python,
* and it is **compatible with frameworks** such as:
  * Machine Learning: TensorFLow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn,
  * Visualization libraries: Seaborn, Altair, Plotly, and
  * Others.

### Why use Streamlit?

During the developing process of data science projects, we always need to
present the results of our findings at certain times. And we sometimes may have
doubts about what would be the best way to show these results. 

Then, this is where tools like Streamlit emerge as a quick way to expose results
that are functional, and don't need complex implementations. 

Streamlit could be seen as an opportunity in situations like:

* **prototyping** quickly,
* create **MVP**,
* put an application into production in a few weeks, and
* share a link with the client or user of the system that is being developed.

So, I think it could be a good option when you want to get a
[prototype](https://www.datarevenue.com/en-blog/data-dashboarding-streamlit-vs-dash-vs-shiny-vs-voila)
of your dashboard/web app up and run it as quickly as possible.

### How does it Work?

1. [Install
   Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/installation). I
   recommend you use **Conda and set up your environment**, but you can use:

    ```shell
    pip install streamlit
    ```

2. [Create](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/create-an-app) a new
   Python script and import Streamlit with a few Streamlit commands:

    ```shell
    import streamlit as st
    ```

3. [Run](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/main-concepts) it:

    ```shell
    streamlit run your_script.py
    ```

    As soon as you run the script, a local Streamlit server will spin up, and
    your app will open in a new tab in your default web browser.

    Or you can navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

### Project Setup

Installing Streamlit is as simple as installing any other Python package.

#### Clone this repository

```shell
(base)$: git clone git@github.com:mafda/data_science_with_fastapi_and_streamlit.git
(base)$: cd data_science_with_fastapi_and_streamlit
```

#### Configure environment

- Create the conda environment

```shell
(base)$: conda env create -f environment.yml
```

- and update with **development dependencies** (Read more about [Python Best
  Practices](https://github.com/mafda/python_best_practices))

```shell
(base)$: conda env update -n ds-app -f environment-dev.yml
```

- Activate the environment

```shell
(base)$: conda activate ds-app
(base)$: git checkout streamlit-basic
```

- Run

```shell
(ds-app)$: streamlit run src/app.py
```

- And go to [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)
